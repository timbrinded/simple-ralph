# Progress Log

## 2026-02-04: Build Screen Live Feedback (COMPLETE)

Implemented all 8 tasks from the `build-screen-live-feedback` PRD:

### Changes Made

**src/app.rs:**
- Added `SPINNER_FRAMES` constant with braille animation characters
- Added `spinner_frame: u8` field to `App` struct
- Added `loop_start_time: Option<Instant>` field to `App` struct
- Implemented `advance_spinner()` method (wraps 0-7)
- Implemented `spinner_char()` method (returns current braille char)
- Implemented `start_loop_timer()` method (sets current instant)
- Implemented `elapsed_display()` method (formats as "Xm Ys" or "Xs")
- Refactored `render_top_panel()` to use Layout for sub-areas
- Added `Gauge` widget showing task progress (X/Y tasks)
- Updated status line to prepend spinner character in cyan
- Updated loop line to include elapsed time
- Added 4 new unit tests for spinner and timer functionality

**src/commands/build.rs:**
- Added `app.advance_spinner()` call in poll loop (animates at ~10fps)
- Added `app.start_loop_timer()` call at start of each loop iteration

### Notes for Next Developer
- The top panel now has 4 distinct regions: PRD name, Gauge, Loop info, Status
- Spinner uses braille chars for smooth animation without extra dependencies
- Elapsed time resets at each loop iteration start
- All quality gates pass (tests, clippy, fmt)
